# BulletHellML
Prototype using BulletML markup language and AndEngine
Author: Ryan Cori
Once I heard about what BulletML was, I knew I wanted to play with it. There is a Unity plugin that would make it much easier to get going
with but I decided I wanted to just tear into the Java code and try to figure it out. Well what uses Java? Android of course! I have 
already used libGDX plenty to work on mobile games and I wanted to try something new. I has heard about AndEngine being an easier, simpler
engine to use and that made it sound perfect for this. So I looked into AndEngine a bit and got going.

AndEngine is simple enough but getting into BulletML was another story. The demo that was built was designed to be run as a Java applet
and has a ton of stuff relating to that. The basic engine would stay the same but the "implementation" code like bullet and action
implementations and the game manager would need some adapting. 

A ton of the work I did here is not int he commit history, I worked without a repo for WAY to long.
